### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Laura, a senior at UC San Diego studying Cognitive Science with a specialization in Machine Learning & Neural Computation, and a minor in Mathematics.

I'm passionate about developing AI systems that can better understand and interact with humans, especially in educational and creative settings. Currently, I'm working on several exciting research projects:

- At the [Natural Computation Lab](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~desa/) with Dr. Virginia de Sa, I'm conducting my honors thesis research on integrating Facial Expression Recognition with Large Language Models to create more emotionally aware educational AI systems.

- I'm exploring human-robot interaction in musical settings with [Dr. Shlomo Dubnov](http://dub.ucsd.edu/) and [Dr. Ross Greer](https://www.rossgreer.com/), focusing on how robots can understand and respond to musicians' nonverbal cues.

- At the [Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles](https://cvrr.ucsd.edu/) with Dr. Mohan Trivedi, I contribute to research on driver behavior analysis using multi-modal machine learning approaches.

I'm fluent in English and German, and in my free time, I serve as President of the Symphonic Student Association at UCSD.

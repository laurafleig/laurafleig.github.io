### Welcome!

I'm Laura, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I am co-advised by [Mathias Unberath](https://www.arcade.cs.jhu.edu/) and [Chien-Ming Huang](https://intuitivecomputing.github.io/index.html). My work focuses on human-robot interaction and human-centered AI, particularly in healthcare settings.

I graduated with a B.S. in Cognitive Science/Machine Learning and a minor in Mathematics from UC San Diego in June 2025. At UCSD, I worked on several exciting research projects:

- At the [Natural Computation Lab](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~desa/) with Dr. Virginia de Sa, I completed my honors thesis on integrating Facial Expression Recognition with Large Language Models to create more emotionally aware educational AI systems.

- I explored human-robot interaction in musical settings with [Dr. Shlomo Dubnov](http://dub.ucsd.edu/) and [Dr. Ross Greer](https://www.rossgreer.com/), focusing on how robots can understand and respond to musicians' nonverbal cues.

- At the [Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles](https://cvrr.ucsd.edu/) with Dr. Mohan Trivedi, I contributed to research on driver behavior analysis using multi-modal machine learning approaches.

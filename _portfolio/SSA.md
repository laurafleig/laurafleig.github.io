I've been part of the Symphonic Student Association (SSA) since my freshman year of college!

## Leadership Role
As President (2024-Present), I:
- Manage a 19-member board through weekly meetings
- Coordinate with UCSD's music department and other organizations
- Organize major events including annual concerts at UCSD's [Epstein Family Amphitheater](https://amphitheater.ucsd.edu/) and the [Che Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/thechecafe/?hl=en)

Before this, I served as Audio/Video Chair from 2022-2021.

Here's a highlight from our concert in May 2024:
